  description: "Opinions are an integral part of how we perceive the world and each other. They shape collective action, playing a role in democratic processes, the evolution of norms, and cultural change. Social and natural scientists have introduced a number of agent-based models which capture important aspects of how opinions change due to interactions between people and due to the influence of external effects like media. I will review idealized models of opinion dynamics, and make a connection to other spreading phenomena. Finally I will summarize recent attempts to validate the models with observational data and controlled sociological experiments. Special attention will be paid to polarization and the ongoing fracture of the sociopolitical landscape."

  description: "Human-AI coevolution, the process in which humans and AI algorithms continuously influence each other, increasingly characterises our society but is understudied in artificial intelligence and complexity science literature. Recommender systems and assistants play a prominent role in human-AI coevolution, permeating many facets of daily life and influencing human choices through online platforms. The interaction between users and AI results in a potentially endless feedback loop, wherein users' choices generate data to train AI models, which, in turn, shape subsequent user preferences. This human-AI feedback loop has peculiar characteristics compared to traditional human-machine interaction, giving rise to complex and often “unintended” systemic outcomes. This talk will discuss relevant studies on the impact of AI-driven recommendations on human behaviour in social media, geographic mapping, online retail and chatbot ecosystems. Moreover, the talk will discuss the human-AI feedback loop and the challenges of measuring and modelling it."

  bio: "Luca Pappalardo is a member of SoBigData.eu, the European research infrastructure on big data analytics and social mining. With a degree in Computer Science, Luca started exploring massive datasets of human movements, publishing several papers on human mobility analysis and modelling. In a natural evolution of his research trajectory, Luca shifted focus to the pressing issue of urban congestion, pioneering efforts centered on designing innovative routing strategies that balance individual travel optimization with the collective well-being of a city. Luca is now broadening his scope to address the profound impact of AI on complex systems in realms like social media, conversational systems, online retail and, of course, urban environments. His overarching goal is to design next-generation algorithms that balance the individual needs of users with broader collective objectives using tools at the intersection of computer science, network science, and computational social science."

  description: "The diffusion of Big Data has not only profoundly affected contemporary society but also unlocked new avenues for social research at all levels. One particular field of application of new data-driven methods is the study of social media and of online political debates. This topic has gained ever greater importance due to the practical influence that social media are playing in society (as seen in social movements and political elections), and for which new methodologies have been progressively developed. One particular subfield of techniques is the so-called <em>sentiment analysis</em>, which - as the name suggests - is concerned with understanding the affective content of online exchanges. In this presentation, I will discuss the state-of-the-art sentiment analysis methods, why they are so important, and what their present limits are. I will also discuss how they are evolving thanks to the emergence of LLMs, emotion detection techniques as well as the turn of social media towards video content. I will highlight how these techniques reflect the general growth of the phenomenon of <em>affective computing</em> (concerned with studying, capturing, measuring, and expressing emotions) and the great interest of both advertisers and politicians in influencing people's emotional states. Finally, I will comment on the practical implications of these developments and how this field of practice raises significant ethical and political concerns."
