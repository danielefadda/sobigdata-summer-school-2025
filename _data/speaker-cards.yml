  description: "Opinions are an integral part of how we perceive the world and each other. They shape collective action, playing a role in democratic processes, the evolution of norms, and cultural change. Social and natural scientists have introduced a number of agent-based models which capture important aspects of how opinions change due to interactions between people and due to the influence of external effects like media. I will review idealized models of opinion dynamics, and make a connection to other spreading phenomena. Finally I will summarize recent attempts to validate the models with observational data and controlled sociological experiments. Special attention will be paid to polarization and the ongoing fracture of the sociopolitical landscape."

Recommender systems and assistants play a prominent role in human-AI coevolution, permeating many facets of daily life and influencing human choices through online platforms. The interaction between users and AI results in a potentially endless feedback loop, wherein users' choices generate data to train AI models, which, in turn, shape subsequent user preferences. This human-AI feedback loop has peculiar characteristics compared to traditional human-machine interaction, giving rise to complex and often “unintended” systemic outcomes. This talk will discuss relevant studies on the impact of AI-driven recommendations on human behaviour in social media, geographic mapping, online retail and chatbot ecosystems.

  description: "Why should data scientists care about the ethical and epistemological dimensions of data and algorithms? Data scientists recognize that their work influences and is influenced by society and knowledge. Ethically, algorithms can reinforce biases, threaten privacy, and lead to unfair or harmful outcomes. Transparency and accountability are crucial to preventing misuse and ensuring fairness. Epistemologically, flawed or biased data can produce misleading conclusions, undermining trust in data-driven decisions. Understanding the limits and assumptions of algorithms helps prevent misinformation. By integrating ethical reflection and epistemic rigor, data scientists can create responsible, fair, and reliable systems that serve society while minimizing harm and unintended consequences. In this talk, I present three epistemic and three ethical concerns relevant to current and future data scientists. The main goal is to spark discussion and debate, fostering a critical reflection on what kind of data science we want."

  description: "The diffusion of Big Data has not only profoundly affected contemporary society but also unlocked new avenues for social research at all levels. One particular field of application of new data-driven methods is the study of social media and of online political debates. This topic has gained ever greater importance due to the practical influence that social media are playing in society (as seen in social movements and political elections), and for which new methodologies have been progressively developed. One particular subfield of techniques is the so-called <em>sentiment analysis</em>, which - as the name suggests - is concerned with understanding the affective content of online exchanges. In this presentation, I will discuss the state-of-the-art sentiment analysis methods, why they are so important, and what their present limits are. I will also discuss how they are evolving thanks to the emergence of LLMs, emotion detection techniques as well as the turn of social media towards video content. I will highlight how these techniques reflect the general growth of the phenomenon of <em>affective computing</em> (concerned with studying, capturing, measuring, and expressing emotions) and the great interest of both advertisers and politicians in influencing people's emotional states. Finally, I will comment on the practical implications of these developments and how this field of practice raises significant ethical and political concerns."

Online social media often limits exposure to diverse perspectives, fostering the formation of like-minded groups that frame and reinforce shared narratives—commonly referred to as echo chambers. This dynamic encourages the growth of active communities centered on conspiracy theories, frequently propagating misinformation about controversial topics. These radicalized communities often demonstrate resilience to bans from mainstream platforms by migrating to niche or fringe social media, where they rebuild and sustain their social structure."
