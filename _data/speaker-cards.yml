  description: "Opinions are an integral part of how we perceive the world and each other. They shape collective action, playing a role in democratic processes, the evolution of norms, and cultural change. Social and natural scientists have introduced a number of agent-based models which capture important aspects of how opinions change due to interactions between people and due to the influence of external effects like media. I will review idealized models of opinion dynamics, and make a connection to other spreading phenomena. Finally I will summarize recent attempts to validate the models with observational data and controlled sociological experiments. Special attention will be paid to polarization and the ongoing fracture of the sociopolitical landscape."

  description: "This talk takes participants on a comprehensive journey towards continually advancing responsible AI operationalization by intertwining three critical elements. Explore how these stages <em>Design, Deploy, and Monitor</em> work harmoniously to foster fairness, compliance, and risk management standards in AI systems. Join this session to equip yourself with the knowledge and tools necessary for optimizing your responsible AI practices, ensuring ethical and accountable AI development and deployment within your organization.<br>
  - Design: Develop practical tools for responsible AI system development.
  .<br>
  - Deploy: Assess risks and ensure compliance with current regulations (e.g., the EU AI Act)
  .<br>
  - Monitor: Address emerging issues by actively monitoring your AI systems (e.g., addressing the unintended use of protected attributes in NLP)."
