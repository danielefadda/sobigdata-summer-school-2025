  description: "Opinions are an integral part of how we perceive the world and each other. They shape collective action, playing a role in democratic processes, the evolution of norms, and cultural change. Social and natural scientists have introduced a number of agent-based models which capture important aspects of how opinions change due to interactions between people and due to the influence of external effects like media. I will review idealized models of opinion dynamics, and make a connection to other spreading phenomena. Finally I will summarize recent attempts to validate the models with observational data and controlled sociological experiments. Special attention will be paid to polarization and the ongoing fracture of the sociopolitical landscape."

  description: "Data has  the unique economic quality of non-rivalry, meaning it can be used by multiple people or entities without diminishing its value or availability to others. Yet the commercial infrastructure built to harvest and process data is excludable, that is, designed  to enforce restricted access, and in turn, supercharge its monetisation and profit. This data model has created dangerous social, political and economic problems, from the rise of the tech oligarchy in Washington, to unprecedented corporate profits and billionaire  fortunes, to the information collapse of polarisation and unmoderated content. The whole time, citizens are increasingly embedded in datafication with little agency or control. This talk will examine a potential positive way forward. Data Altruism was granted  statutory footing by the Data Governance Act from Sept 2023; it will enable citizens to share their data with greater consent, control, and privacy in a manner that has demonstrable societal good. We will outline the technical challenges to building such a new open infrastructure, with a safe user pipeline, and a multi-level workflow for data scientists. We will present our plan to make non-rivalrous data non-excludable, enabling everyday users and researchers to more easily access the generative power of data."
