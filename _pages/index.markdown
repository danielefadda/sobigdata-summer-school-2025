The Summer School provides a unique interdisciplinary mixture where participants can explore state-of-the-art tools in data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. The school will have lessons from experts during the morning and will leave the afternoon to group work guided by dedicated tutors helping them in defining and developing their project which will be evaluated at the end of the school by a panel of experts.

            <h3>AIM OF THE SCHOOL</h3>
                <p>
                The Summer School aims to equip researchers, data scientists, and social scientists with an interdisciplinary understanding and skill set to address complex societal challenges. By blending technical training in data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence with ethical, political, and social dynamics, the program empowers the students in facing today’s pressing societal challenges with a balanced approach that combines innovative data methodologies, stakeholder awareness, and a commitment to responsible, transparent practices.</p>
                <p>
                Over four themed days, participants first explore the new European research framework—covering directives, open science principles, and data-sharing policies. Next, they dive into Information Dynamics, examining how (dis)information is created, transferred, and transformed. The third focus, Political Dynamics, looks at how policy, ideology, institutions, and individuals shape discussions and social discourse. Finally, Social Dynamics reveals how communities and institutions influence each other, how societal structures evolve, and how collective behaviors emerge.
                Expert-led lectures throughout the mornings expose participants to state-of-the-art methods and real-world case studies, highlighting best practices and contemporary applications of big data and AI. The afternoon sessions are dedicated to collaborative group projects, allowing students to actively engage in hands-on learning experiences. At the end of the week, a panel of experts in data mining and AI will evaluate the projects. This approach ensures a comprehensive and interactive learning environment allowing the participants to explore the ethical, legal, and practical dimensions of leveraging data for societal well-being.
